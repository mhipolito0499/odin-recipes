    <p>
        If you ever wanted a pepperoni pizza, but not the carbs to go with it,
        then this is the perfect recipe for you. This recipe will make your pizza 
        crisp, crunchy, and oh yeah, LOW CARB. This is Greg's recipe on ruled.me
        and here's how to make it:
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Pizza Base</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> almond flour</li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> psyllium husk powder</li>
        <li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> cream cheese</li>
        <li><strong>1 large</strong> egg</li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> Italian seasoning</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 cup</strong> mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> tomato sauce</li>
        <li><strong>16 slices</strong> pepperoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat oven to 400F</strong>. Measure out 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and put into a microwave safe bowl. This is about 8 oz. of cheese.</li>
        <li>Microwave the cheese until fully melted and pliable. Try not to have any more browning than the picture indicates (browned cheese will go hard). This took me ~90 seconds. Add 3 tbsp. cream cheese and 1 egg to the cheese and mix it in well.</li>
        <li>Add 3/4 cup <em>almond flour</em>, 1 tbsp. <em>psyllium husk powder</em>, 1 tbsp. <em>Italian seasoning</em>, 1/2 tsp. <em>salt and pepper</em> to the cheese mixture and mix together.</li>
        <li>As you mix the dough, it should become cool enough to work with your hands. Knead the dough together until you can form a round ball.</li>
        <li>Plop the ball onto a silpat (these are awesome, by the way) with 1 tsp. olive oil to keep it easy to work with. Press the dough out with your hands, forming a circular pattern as you press outward.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 10 minutes on one side and remove from the oven. I prefer to bake the pizza on an upside down cookie sheet - this allows for the pizza to spread out slightly without being constricted or contorted by the edges of the cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Flip the pizza to the other side and bake for another 2-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and top with toppings of your choice (in this case: 1/2 cup Rao's tomato sauce, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and 16 slices pepperoni).</li>
        <li>Bake again for an additional 3-5 minutes, or until cheese is nicely melted.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly, cut into slices, and serve. Optionally, sprinkle oregano over the top!</li>
    </ol>
